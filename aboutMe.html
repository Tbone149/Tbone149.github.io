<p class="text"> 10/30: First journal entry. So far I've made this basic website and published it on github through a series of terminal programs. I still don't know how to make the plane work on the home page but I will get there. I have all my pages, though, I just need to add some features to make it more interesting.</p>
<br>
<p class="text"> Helicopter Project: This is an event listener that moves a gif across the screen. Typing triggers an animation (and it also says "mayday" in the console). Originally I wanted it to fall also, so you could land it, I will try and incorporate that feature later.</p>
<br>
<p class="text">Cool Button Project: This is more of an artistic feature for a website. I'm not using it anywhere because of the plane design I chose instead. I learned how to make this from a guy who was giving an example lesson to become Molly's sub.</p>
<br>
<p class="text">The Image Above: This is a fun little project I made with a click event listener. The way it works is it has a variable that increases with each click, and if it is divisible by two one image is shown, if not the other. This is one of my favorite projects.</p>
<br>
<p class="text">Bottles Event Listener: This one is a simple project where if you click a bottle is created. I'm hoping to improve it so if you click a certain key or something like that one of the bottles shatters. I don't quite know how to do that yet, but I will try to get it working after break.</p>
<br>
<p class="text">Plane Crash: A while ago, I started working on a project where if you clicked on something the computer would give you warnings, and if you continued to click something would happen. I didn't really know where to go from there, though. I finally finished it recently, and I like the product.</p>
